# Stockfish Chess engine

This is a chess engine built using python and c++.

> **Status:** Working â€” feature-complete for core functionality. Implementing serializing engine access with a lock (or single worker queue) planned.

## Building the binary executable

clone the repo recursively inorder to access the [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) repo and build the executable. Follow the instructions from there and continue onwards. I have pre-included an executable inside bin.


## Quick Start (Linux/Windows)

I prefer using a virtual environment, adjust to your preferences

### Clone the repo recursively
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OneNonly-God/ChessEngine.git
```

* Go inside the repo and continue.

### Installing python modules and configuration

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install python-chess
```

### Run the app
```bash
python sf_test.py
```

### What I plan to add maybe someday

* **disabling controls while the engine is busy**
* **Hotkeys and shortcuts for certain actions**
