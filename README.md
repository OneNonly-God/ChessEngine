## Quick Start (Linux/Windows)

* I prefer using a virtual environment, adjust to your preferences.

### Clone the repo recursively
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OneNonly-God/ChessEngine.git
```

* Go inside the repo and continue.

### Installing python modules and configuration

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install python-chess
```

## Building the binary executable

The [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) should be installed. Build the executeable according to your platform and replace the pre-existing stockfish binary inisde bin if required.
(**The executeable only works for linux thats why you must build it yourself**)


### Run the app
```bash
python sf.py
```

### What I plan to add maybe someday

* **disabling controls while the engine is busy**
* **Hotkeys and shortcuts for certain actions**
* **Implement and fix resizeabiltiy**
